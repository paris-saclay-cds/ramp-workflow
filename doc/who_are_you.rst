Who are you
###########

I am a data science student
***************************

You can learn about data science by signing up to ongoing and past data
challenges on the `RAMP Studio`_ website. Sign up for the site then choose a
`theme`_ or a `data domain`_ to find a challenge of interest to you. Find an
open event for your challenge of interest and sign up. See :ref:`using-kits`
for more details.

If the challenge is in "open leaderboard" mode, you can browse the code
of all the submissions, including the best ones submitted by top students or
professional data scientists. You can also download and play with the RAMP
`starting kits`_, independently of the data challenges on `RAMP Studio`_.

I am a practicing data scientist
********************************

If you have a dataset and a predictive problem, you can
:ref:`build your own workflow <build-challenge>` using the `ramp-workflow`_
library, following examples from RAMP `starting kits`_. You can then train and
test your models locally and log both the models and scores in a simple
file structure. If you want to collaborate with your fellow team members, you
can use git and upload your RAMP starting kit to GitHub.

You can also use `RAMP Studio`_ to expose your kit either privately to your
internal team or by launching a public data challenge. If you are interested in
these options, `contact us`_.

I am a data science teacher
***************************

If you would like to use one of the existing RAMP challenges with our
RAMP server system, for teaching purposes, ask for a new event at
`RAMP Studio`_. You can browse the existing challenges by the data science
`theme`_ you would like to focus on in your course, or by the `data domain`_
you would like to apply data science to.

If you have your own data set and a predictive problem, you can
prepare a RAMP challenge your course. See :ref:`build-challenge` for more
information.

I am a machine learning researcher
**********************************

You can benchmark your new algorithm against all previous solutions submitted
for a specific data challenge on `RAMP Studio`_. You can start by downloading
the starting kit that you would like to use for benchmarking, from the GitHub
repository `ramp-kits <https://github.com/ramp-kits>`_, and test your algorithm
locally. You can then sign up at `RAMP Studio`_ and register for one of the
events corresponding to the challenge you choose. You can then submit your
algorithm as many times as you want and you will have access to the public
leaderboard score described in the starting kit.

If you register with us for an official benchmarking, we will provide you a
private test score for a small number of submissions of your choice, at a date
of your choice (but only once).

I am a researcher in a domain science
*************************************

If you have a predictive problem, you can submit it as a data challenge to
incite data scientists to solve your problem. First, build your own workflow
using the `ramp-workflow`_ library, following examples from RAMP
`starting kits`_, then `contact us`_ so we can upload it to `RAMP Studio`_. We
can then organize hackathons or longer data challenges, and use the problem in
a classroom setting. We may also automatically benchmark the thousands of
models that are already in the platform. You can also `contact us`_ if you
have problems setting up a challenge using RAMP workflow.
