Who are you
###########

I am a data science student
***************************

You can **learn about data science** by signing up to ongoing and past data
challenges at `ramp.studio <http://www.ramp.studio/problems>`_. Sign up for the
site then choose a `topic <http://www.ramp.studio/data_science_themes>`_ or a
`data domain <http://www.ramp.studio/data_domains>`_ and sign up to the
corresponding event. Most events are in "open leaderboard" mode which means
that you can **browse the code** of all the submissions, including the best
ones submitted by top students or professional data scientists.

You can also download and play with the 
`starting kits <https://github.com/ramp-kits>`_, independently of the data
challenges.

I am a practicing data scientist
********************************

You can build your own workflow using the `ramp-workflow
<https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow>`_ library, following
examples from `ramp-kits <https://github.com/ramp-kits>`_. You can then
**train and test your models locally** and keep track of them in a simple file
structure. If you want to **collaborate with your fellow team members**, you
can simply commit your kit and use git.

You can also use `ramp.studio <http://www.ramp.studio>`_ to expose your kit
either privately to your internal team or by launching a public data challenge.
If you are interested in these options, `contact us
<mailto:admin@ramp.studio>`_.

I am a data science teacher
***************************

If you would like to use one of the existing `ramp-kits
<https://github.com/ramp-kits>`_ and the corresponding data challenge in a
classroom, ask for a new event at the `RAMP site
<http://www.ramp.studio/problems>`_. You can browse the existing challenges by
the `data science theme <http://www.ramp.studio/data_science_themes>`_ you
would like to focus on in your course, or by the `data domain
<http://www.ramp.studio/data_domains>`_ you would like to apply data science to.

If you have your own data set and would like to build a new starting kit and
challenge for your course, go to :ref:``.

I am a machine learning researcher
**********************************

You can benchmark your new algorithm against all our data challenges on
`ramp.studio <http://www.ramp.studio/problems>`_. You can start by downloading
the starting kit, from the GitHub repository `ramp-kits
<https://github.com/ramp-kits>`_, that you would like to use for benchmark, and
test your algorithm locally. You can then sign up at the `RAMP site
<http://www.ramp.studio>`_ and register for one of the events corresponding to
the kit you chose. You can submit your algorithm as many times as you want.
You will have access to the public leaderboard score described in the starting
kit.

If you register with us for an official benchmarking, we will provide you a
private test score for a small number of submissions of your choice, at a date
of your choice (but only once).

I am a researcher in a domain science
*************************************

If you have a predictive problem, you can submit it as a data challenge to
incite data scientists to solve your problem. First build your own workflow
using the `ramp-workflow <https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow>`_
library, following examples from `ramp-kits <https://github.com/ramp-kits>`_,
then `contact us <mailto:admin@ramp.studio>`_ so we can upload it to the
`RAMP site <http://www.ramp.studio>`_. We can then organize hackathons or
longer data challenges, and use the problem in a classroom setting. We may also
automatically benchmark the thousands of models that are already in the
platform.
