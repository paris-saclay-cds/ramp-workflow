Build your own RAMP challenge
#############################

If you have a new data set and a predictive problem, you may wish to use RAMP
to organise local experiments within your team, log model prototypes
and their scores or formalise your problem with resuable workflow building
blocks. If you are a :ref:`researcher <researcher-domain-science>` you may
be interested in setting up a RAMP event to incite data scientists and machine
learning researchers to provide machine learning solutions to your predictive
problem. In this section we walk you through what you need to do to either use
RAMP workflow locally or to launch a RAMP event. 

To setup your predictive problem to use RAMP workflow, the following
files are required:

* ``problem.py`` - this parametrizes the setup and uses building blocks from
  RAMP workflow. More information about writing this script can be found at
  :ref:`problem`.
* ``submissions/`` - each solution to be tested should be stored in its own
  directory within ``submissions/``. The name of this new directory will serve
  as the ID for the submission. If you wish to launch a RMAP chellenge you
  will need to provide an example solution within ``submissions/starting_kit``.
  Even if you are not launching a RAMP event, it is useful to have an
  example submission as it shows which files are required, how they need to
  be named and how each file should be structured.
* data files - the data files of the challenge can be stored with your starting
  kit in a folder named ``data/``. Alternatively, your data may also be
  downloaded from elsewhere (:ref:`download-data`). More information about
  preparing your data can be found at :ref:`data`.

Once you have the above files, it is quite easy to prepare the additional files
required for a full RAMP 'starting kit'. These files are not required for
RAMP workflow to function locally but are useful for participants and are
required to launch a RAMP event.

* starting kit notebook - this is a jupyter notebook that introduces the
  predictive problem, provides some background information, exploratory
  data analysis and data visualisation, the workflow and a baseline
  example solution. This baseline solution is generally the same solution
  within ``submissions/starting_kit`` (see above).
* ``requirements.txt`` - lists the required packages, for participants that
  wish to use ``pip``.
* ``environment.yml`` - lists the required packages, for participants that wish
  to use ``conda``.
* ``README.md`` - this is the homepage when the challenge is on GitHub and
  
The base diretory of a full ramp-kit should thus look like::

    <ramp_kit_name>/    # root ramp-kit directory
    ├── README.md
    ├── download_data.py (optional)
    ├── problem.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── <ramp_kit_name>_starting_kit.ipynb
    ├── data
    └── submissions/
        └── <starting_kit>/
