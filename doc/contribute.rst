Testing ramp-board
------------------

Since ramp-board_ depends on ramp-workflow, any time that there is a PR in ramp-workflow, ramp-board_ should also be tested using the following sequence:

 1. Under `ramp-board GitHub Actions <https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-board/actions/workflows/main.yml>`_ in the `main` workflow select "Run Workflow" and in the dropdown menu paste the a pip installable URL to the version of  ramp-workflow from your PR. For instance it would look as folllows,::

      https://github.com/<your fork>/ramp-workflow/archive/refs/heads/<your branch>.zip


 2. If the tests are green, the PR'd branch of ramp-workflow can be accepted.
 3. If it is not, ramp-board_ should be fixed:

    1. Start a new branch in ramp-board_, preferably of the same name as the PR'd branch of ramp-workflow, on top of rampwf_test_.
    2. Fix the error on the new branch, make sure that the tests are green when pulling from ramp-workflow from the PR'd branch in environment.yml_ and environment_iris_kit.yml_.
    3. Accept the PR'd branch on ramp-workflow and update pypi.
    4. Modify environment.yml_ and environment_iris_kit.yml_ to pip install ramp-workflow from pypi and check again that the test are green.
    5. Accept the PR on ramp-board_.
