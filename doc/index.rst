Welcome to RAMP-workflow's documentation!
=========================================

RAMP-workflow is part of the `RAMP <https://www.ramp.studio/>`_ ecosystem.
The purpose of RAMP is to define, build, manage, and optimize data analytics
workflows, typically on the top of open source machine learning libraries like
pandas, scikit-learn, and keras. RAMP-workflow consists of a set of reusable
tools and scripts to define `score types

(metrics), `workflow elements

and `prediction types <https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/tree/master/rampwf/prediction_types>`_.
