The [RAMP][rstudio] ecosystem contains two organizations and two libraries. The purpose of the bundle is to __define, build, manage, and optimize data analytics workflows__, typically on the top of open source machine learning libraries like [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), and [keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras). The bundle consists of

| Library/Organization | Purpose | Publicly available |
| :------ | :-----  | :------: |
| [ramp-workflow][rworkflow] | A set of reusable tools and scripts to define [score types](rampwf/score_types) (metrics), [workflow elements](rampwf/workflows), [prediction types](rampwf/prediction_types) and data connectors. | :white_check_mark: |
| [ramp-board][rboard] |  A library managing the frontend and the database of the [RAMP][rstudio] platform. | :no_entry_sign: |
| [ramp-data][rdata] | An organization containing data sets on which workflows are trained and evaluated. | :no_entry_sign: |
| [ramp-kits][rkits] | An organization containing *starting kits* that use tools from [ramp-workflow][rworkflow] to implement a first valid (tested) workflow. | :white_check_mark: |


## Why do I want this bundle ?

- [I am a data science teacher](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/I-am-a-data-science-teacher)
- [I am a data science student or novice data scientist](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/I-am-a-data-science-student)
- [I am a practicing data scientist](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/I-am-a-practicing-data-scientist)
- [I am a researcher in machine learning](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/I-am-a-machine-learning-researcher)
- [I am a researcher in a domain science or I have a predictive problem in my business](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/I-am-a-researcher-in-a-domain-science)

## Getting started

1. Install the latest `ramp-workflow` library 

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow.git
```

This will set up some command line scripts like `ramp_test_submission`.
We suggest to use a dedicated virtual environment if you are familiar with it.

2. Pick a starting-kit on <https://github.com/ramp-kits>

Clone it locally and fire up the starting kit notebook.  
It will guide you through the problem, describe the data and the workflow, and let you run the pipeline.
