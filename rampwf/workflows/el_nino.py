"""A time series feature extractor followed by a regressor.

Train and test a time series feature extractor followed by a regressor.

The input object is an `xarray` `Dataset`, containing possibly several
`DataArrays` corresponding to the input sequence. It contains a special burn
in period in the beginning (carried by X_ds.n_burn_in) for which we do not
give ground truth and we do not require the user to provide predictions.
The ground truth sequence `y_array` in train and the output of the user
submission `ts_fe.transform` are thus `n_burn_in` shorter than the input
sequence `X_ds`, making the training and testing slightly complicated.
