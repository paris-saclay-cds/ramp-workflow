"""A time series feature extractor.

Train and test a time series feature extractor.

The input object is an `xarray` `Dataset`, containing possibly several
`DataArrays` corresponding to the input sequence. It contains a special burn
in period in the beginning (carried by X_ds.n_burn_in) for which we do not
give ground truth and we do not require the user to provide predictions.
The ground truth sequence `y_array` in train and the output of the user
submission `ts_fe.transform` are thus `n_burn_in` shorter than the input
sequence `X_ds`, making the training and testing slightly complicated.

The other particularity of this workflow is that the input `X_ds` that the
*test* receives may contain information about the (future) labels, so it is
technically possible to cheat. We developed a randomized technique to
safeguard against this. The workflow has two init parameters: `check_sizes`
and `check_indexs`. Both are lists of indices. The idea is that we first
run `transform` on the original `X_ds`, obtaining the feature matrix
`X`. Then we randomly change elements of `X_ds` after
`n_burn_in + check_index`, and then check if the features in the new
`X_check_array` change *before* `n_burn_in + check_index` wrt `X`.
If they do, the submission is illegal. If they don't, it is possible that
the user carefully avoided looking ahead at this prticular index, so we may
test at another index, to be added to the list `check_indexs`. The other
list `check_sizes` makes it possible to make a shorter copy of the full
sequence in this check, to save time. Obviously each `check_size` should be
bigger than the corresponding `check_index`.
