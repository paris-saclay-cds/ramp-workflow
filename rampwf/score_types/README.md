# RAMP score types (metrics)

`score_types` is an abstraction of predictive quality metrics. Classes are wrappers of (typically scikit-learn) score metrics. Each score type has the following class variables:
* `is_lower_the_better` : boolean
* `minimum` : float
* `maximum` : float
* `worse` : float

  It is implemented in `BaseScoreType` as a property, used tytpically in loops to find the best of a list of scores.

Each score type has the following member variables:
* `name` : string
  
  It has a typical default that the user can redefine. Its main use is to name the columns of the leaderboard.
* `precision` : integer
  
  The number of digits after the decimal point when scores are displayed, for example, on the leaderboard.

Each score type has the following member functions:
* `score_function`
  
  It implements a wrapper function that takes
  * `ground_truths` : rampwf.prediction_types.BasePrediction
    The ground truth, typically a numpy array `y_true` wrapped into a prediction type.
  * `predictions` : rampwf.prediction_types.BasePrediction
    The prediction, typically a numpy array `y_pred` wrapped into a prediction type.
  * `valid_indexes` : list of integers with default `None`
    Optionally a set of cross validation fold indexes.
  
  It is called in `ramp_test_submission` and at the [ramp-board][rboard] frontend when evaluating user submissions. Most of the time it uses the default implementation in `BaseScoreType` that optionally selects the cv fold and checks if the number of rows are identical in `y_true` and `y_pred`, then calls `__call__(self, y_true, y_pred)`. `ClassifierBaseScoreType` does the same except it calls `__call__` with `y_true_label_index` and `y_pred_label_index`. When __call__ raises a non implemented error, `score_function` has to be overridden.
* `__call__`
  
  It implements a wrapper function that takes
  * `y_true` : np.array
    The ground truth.
  * `y_pred` : np.array
    The prediction.
  
  It is an optional function (when not implemented, e.g., in `Combined`, it raises an error) called by `score_function` or, typically, in user notebooks where folds are selected by the user and checks are unnecessary. It typically calls a scikit learn metrics or implements a metrics which doesn't exist there.
