            # passed to `fit_generator`. So if nothing is done and `workers`

            # repetitions of the same data, because the workers are independent
            # and they got through the same generator.

            # processes so that they load different data, this can become a bit
            # complicated, so I choose to rather load exactly one chunk at a
            # time using 1 worker (so `workers` have to be equal to 1), but
