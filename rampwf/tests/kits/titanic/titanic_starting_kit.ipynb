First, if it is your first time using RAMP, [sign up](http://www.ramp.studio/sign_up), otherwise [log in](http://www.ramp.studio/login). Then find an open event on the particular problem, for example, the event [titanic](http://www.ramp.studio/events/titanic) for this RAMP. Sign up for the event. Both signups are controled by RAMP administrators, so there **can be a delay between asking for signup and being able to submit**.\n",

Save it, rename it, then submit it. The submission is trained and tested on our backend in the same way as `ramp_test_submission` does it locally. While your submission is waiting in the queue and being trained, you can find it in the \"New submissions (pending training)\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/titanic/my_submissions). Once it is trained, you get a mail, and your submission shows up on the [public leaderboard](http://www.ramp.studio/events/titanic/leaderboard). \n",
